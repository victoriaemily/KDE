# Setting Up & Learning Hugo

KDE uses Hugo to template a lot of their subdomains, so I figured it would be relevant to learn to help improve accessability & overall function across their different sites. I had only used CSS & a little bit of React to help format my sites before this, so I tried my hand at using Hugo for templating this site. 

I (of course) downloaded Hugo, set up a theme, and went on to set some features that the demo site for PaperMod had. I enabled a menu, tagging system (apparently Hugo has a taxonomy system that automatically collects tags from your posts & displays it neatly for you!! with a link to it), and a nifty search system.

So, this led to the site you see right now!

I also set up Gitlab & SSH keys and saw this neat easter egg on invent.kde.org:

I've forked the main Krita.org website on Gitlab & cloned it into my local machine.

# Goals for the Week:
 - get comfortable with Gitlab (contribute small changes through the fork i made)
 - after that, help improve site accessability
 - learn to utilize custom css in Hugo
