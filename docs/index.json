[{"content":"I had never heard of KDE prior to learning about Season of KDE, but I had actually used one of their developed softwares before even knowing it was associated with KDE - Krita. I started this blog in interest of Season of KDE, but I hope to start to contribute to OSS like KDE even outside of SoK. :)\nSetting Up \u0026amp; Learning Hugo KDE uses Hugo to template a lot of their subdomains, so I figured it would be relevant to learn to help improve accessability \u0026amp; overall function across their different sites. I had only used CSS \u0026amp; a little bit of React to help format my sites before this, so I tried my hand at using Hugo for templating this site.\nI (of course) downloaded Hugo, set up a theme, and went on to set some features that the demo site for PaperMod had. I enabled a menu, tagging system (apparently Hugo has a taxonomy system that automatically collects tags from your posts \u0026amp; displays it neatly for you!! with a link to it), and a nifty search system.\nSo, this led to the site you see right now!\nI also set up Gitlab \u0026amp; SSH keys and saw this neat easter egg on invent.kde.org: I\u0026rsquo;ve forked the main Krita.org website on Gitlab \u0026amp; cloned it into my local machine.\nGoals for the Next Few Weeks: get comfortable with Gitlab (contribute small changes through the fork i made) research site acessibility according to WCAG guidelines learn to utilize custom CSS with Hugo ultimately, view site source codes and contribute a potential change ","permalink":"http://victoriaemily.github.io/KDE/posts/hugo--setting-goals/","summary":"I had never heard of KDE prior to learning about Season of KDE, but I had actually used one of their developed softwares before even knowing it was associated with KDE - Krita.
