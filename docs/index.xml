      <description>Start of SoK Hello! Today (in UTC) marks the official start of Season of KDE! In about two weeks or so, I&amp;rsquo;ll update the site on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, but recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading up on web accessibility guidelines according to those latest published by WCAG.
WCAG During my research, I noted the following that could be applicable to KDE&amp;rsquo;s main sites, with the following in quotes either paraphrased or taken directly from WCAG 2.</description>

      <description>I had never heard of KDE prior to learning about Season of KDE, but I had actually used one of their developed softwares before even knowing it was associated with KDE - Krita. I started this blog in interest of Season of KDE, but I hope to start to contribute to OSS like KDE even outside of SoK. :)
Setting Up &amp;amp; Learning Hugo KDE uses Hugo to template a lot of their subdomains, so I figured it would be relevant to learn to help improve accessability &amp;amp; overall function across their different sites.</description>
