      <description>I had never heard of KDE prior to learning about Season of KDE, but I had actually used one of their developed softwares before even knowing it was associated with KDE - Krita. I started this blog in interest of Season of KDE, but I hope to start to contribute to OSS like KDE even outside of SoK. :)
Setting Up &amp;amp; Learning Hugo KDE uses Hugo to template a lot of their subdomains, so I figured it would be relevant to learn to help improve accessability &amp;amp; overall function across their different sites.</description>
